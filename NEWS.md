## 0.6.6 to 0.6.7

   Recommends fody-backend v>=0.6.4


## 0.6.5 to 0.6.6

 * Stats: Change display of subqueries to show the description.
 * Contacts: Add handling of email tags.


## 0.6.4 to 0.6.5

 * Tickets: (minor) Improves details view of send out email:
   aligns values left.


## 0.6.2 to 0.6.3

 * Tickets: Improves details view of send out email: Removes display of
   `template_name`; centers table.

 * Tickets: Improves displaying details about a send out ticket. It shows
   more information in a small table now, including the `template_format`.
 * Tickets: Changes behaviour to always show up to 10,000 events. If there are
   more events, the ones with the lowest `events_id` will be shown.

   to the end if a digit is entered in the middle of a number for browsers

### Upgrade
 * technical:
   Depends on fody-backend v>=0.6.1.


## 0.6.0 to 0.6.1

 * Contacts: (minor) Improves input of integers to avoid showing a superfluous
   dot.


## 0.5.2 to 0.6.0

 * Tickets, Stats: Raises display limit from <10,000 to <=50,000 events.
   So tickets with a higher number of events can be displayed
   at the cost of more time for loading the data. A message is shown if
   events will not be shown because of the limit.
 * Contacts: Improves entering an ASN or the sector-id, by disallowing
   incremental changes to avoid accidental change by a mouse wheel event
   and more rigidly checking for a natural number.
 * Contacts: Sorts the list of otherAttributes by their keys when editing,
   which makes the order consistent with both display only and editing.


## 0.5.1 to 0.5.2

 * Stats: Makes csv export files directly parsable for libreoffice by adding
     an ISO 8601 column.
 * Tickets, Stats: Improves the events detail view by displaying
     the `extra` attribute.
 * Stats: (minor) Adds minutes to the hourly x-axis-label to be more common.

## 0.2.0 to 0.2.1-dev

 * minor, technical:
   Make sure that the subpages are also directly routed by the HTTP server,
   for examples with hug like
   ```
   @hug.get(urls=['/', '/tickets', '/contacts', '/stats', '/settings', '/login'],
            output=hug.output_format.file)
   def root():
           return("/home/fody/www/index.html")
   ```
